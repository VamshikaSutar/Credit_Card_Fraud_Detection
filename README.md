The aim of this project, "Credit Card Fraud Detection" is to develop and implement an advanced 
fraud detection system that leverages supervised techniques such as Random Forest 
classification, Logistic Regression, SVC and unsupervised autoencoder neural networks to 
enhance the accuracy and efficiency of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. This 
study attempts to improve overall financial transaction security by developing a model that can 
learn the underlying patterns of lawful transactions and detect abnormalities associated with 
fraudulent behavior. The study also aims to compare the effectiveness of the autoencoder-based 
system to standard fraud detection approaches, as well as to evaluate its adaptability to emerging 
fraud patterns in real-world scenarios.
